# Termux:GUI
https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.gui/

>A plugin for Termux to use the Android GUI from terminal applications.

>With this plugin you can make GUI applications in Termux without using VNC or a X11 server.
>This plugin uses the native Android GUI components to display everything.
>That means it seamlessly integrates into the Android experience, but standard applications written for X11 don't work.
>Also it requires a minimum of knowledge of how the Android GUI works.
>See [the README](https://github.com/termux/termux-gui/blob/main/README.md) for a crash course.
